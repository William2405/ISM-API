ISM-API
=======

Image Stack Movie(ISM) is a file format made out of a stack of images stored inside a single file. ISM is currently 
compatible with Java.The ISM API is a easy to use and understand API, it uses all Java 1.6+ compatible objects including
BufferedImages.

The ISM API is currently very slow at loading ISM files and is a memory hog.
